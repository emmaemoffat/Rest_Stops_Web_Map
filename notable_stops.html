        <h2 class="card-name"> Hill County Safety Rest Area </h2>
        <p class="profile-text"> The Hill County safety rest area is located along I-35 in between Waco and DFW, putting it
                                at a key high traffic location. The architecture of the rest area is meant to mimic the
                                local culture of farming in the blackland prairie, with the main building resembling
                                a barn and the restrooms built to look like silos. </p>

        <h2 class="card-name"> Guadalupe County Safety Rest Area </h2>
        <p class= "card-description"> The unique architecture and features such as the interactive displays, walking trail,
                                      and playground would make it a nice rest stop to visit. The site planning and architecture
                                      was influenced by the wooded site and local vernacular construction, with deeply shaded porches
                                      and full height lobby windows providing transparency between the indoor and outdoor spaces. </p>

        <p class= "card-description"> This new and improved rest stop facility was completed in June of 2024, making it one of Texas'
                                      newest additions. The building follows a contemporary adobe style which allows optimal mountain views
                                      and surrounding native landscaping. This rest stop is unique for including a space room based on the space tourism
                                      that is present in the local towns. </p>
